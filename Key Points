ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

Based on the Git workflow, the typical stages for file tracking are:

- Untracked â†’ Staging â†’ Tracked

This progression represents how Git manages files:

- Untracked: New files that Git doesn't yet track
- Staging: Files added to the staging area with 'git add', ready to be committed
- Tracked: Files that have been committed and are now tracked by Git
